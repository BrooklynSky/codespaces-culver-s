    <p> Whether we’re cooking the perfect ButterBurger® to order or scooping up our freshest batch of the Flavor of the Day, we work hard to ensure you will always leave happy.

It all goes back to our small-town Wisconsin roots. We know you have a lot to do and many options to choose from, so we appreciate when you take the time to visit Culver’s. If we can do our part to make your day better – with a wholesome, delicious meal or a heartfelt smile – we’ve done our job. As Craig Culver always says, "We never compromise on quality." It’s a promise that begins with sourcing the best ingredients and continues through to the way we prepare your meal: fresh, just for you. 

It’s why we always use fresh, never frozen beef and whole, white meat chicken from America's family farms. It’s why we only use family farm-fresh dairy for our Frozen Custard. And it’s why every single Cheese Curd we’ve served has come from a Wisconsin dairy farm. We care about where your food comes from because we know you do too. 

We also know quality is something you can taste. So every ButterBurger is cooked to order and topped with a lightly buttered, toasted bun. And our Fresh Frozen Custard is made in small batches right in the restaurant all day, every day. It’s not the easiest way to do it, but we believe it’s the right way.  </p>
