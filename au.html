    <p><b>Hometown Hospitality</b>
Hospitality has always been near and dear to our hearts. So, dining in or on the go, we make a point of treating you the way we’d want to be treated. From holding a door to asking about your meal, it’s our pleasure to serve you – and we do it with a smile. 

Our dedication to hospitality goes back to Craig’s mother, Ruth Culver, who had a special way about her that made every guest who visited Culver’s feel welcomed like a guest in her home. Carrying on her legacy continues to be our truest measure of success, whether in our first restaurant in Sauk City or one of the 900-plus Culver’s locations across the United States. </p>
